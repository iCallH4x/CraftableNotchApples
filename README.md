A really simple plugin to allow you to craft Notch apples with the old crafting recipe.

It's literally like 20 lines of code and I haven't tested it on other versions, but I know some of you guys out there, like me, want this feature on the latest version of Minecraft!


NOTE: There will be minimal support provided for this plugin, it works on 1.18 and other versions are not tested as of yet. It should work on future versions though.
